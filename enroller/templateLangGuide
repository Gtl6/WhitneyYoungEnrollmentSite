    For the usage of taking form values and generating pages with them, I have created a basic template language.
Included is the information on the tag values, and what they mean.

After each entry must be included the dbName for later referral, starting with a #
Note: When naming your prompts, DO NOT use ANY escape characters (', n, t, etc), as they do not allow the tool that
pushes data to the database to find the database entry. I understand this is limiting, please work around it.

'*a' = Address value to follow (special input form, see below)
'*b' = Boolean yes/no value to follow (Radio list of 'yes/no value'
'*c' = Country value to follow (Select list with all countries included)
'*d' = Date value to follow (Date prompt input)
'*g' = Guardian Contact information to follow (special input form, see below)
'*n' = Number input to follow, next tells len of number, then the name of the field
'*t' = Title to follow
'*ut' = Underlined Title to follow
'*v' = verification checkbox to follow

If a non-specified entry is followed by a list, it will become a Radio list

    If a non-specified entry is followed by another non-specified entry, a tag, or the end of the list, it will
register as a text-input box

An Address is made up of the following prompts:
    Street Number and Name, text input
    Apartment Number, number input
    City, text input
    State, dropdown list
    Zipcode, number input of fixed len 5

A Guardian is made up of the following prompts:
    Name, text input
    Relationship, text input
    List of options to select, can select all (checkbox list):
        Lives with student
        Gets mailings for student
        Can contact in case of emergency
        Has permission to pick up student
    Home Address of the guardian
    Home Phone #, phone number input
    Cell Phone #, phone number input
    Email Address, text input
    Name of Employer, text input
    Work Phone #, phone number input
    Communication Language, text input

If you need to expand the template language, just add an entry for the tag, and make sure that it has a description.
Also try to keep the entries alphabetical, it's just easier to refer to it that way
